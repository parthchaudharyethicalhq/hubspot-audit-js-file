        Based on your HubSpot configuration and goals, here are my prioritized recommendations:

        ### 1. [First Recommendation - Highest Priority]
        **What**: [Clear description of what should be implemented or changed]
        **Why**: [Explanation of benefits and how it addresses their challenges]
        **How**: [Brief implementation guidance with 2-3 specific steps]

        ### 2. [Second Recommendation]
        **What**: [Clear description of what should be implemented or changed]

        [Continue with recommendations 3-10, following the same format]

        Important guidelines:
        - Each recommendation should be specific, actionable, and tailored to their situation
        - Focus recommendations on their stated goals and challenges
        - Include a mix of quick wins and strategic improvements
        - For the Impact-Confidence-Ease analysis, prioritize recommendations that would have high impact, high confidence in success, and reasonable ease of implementation
        - Ensure recommendations span different aspects of HubSpot (data management, automation, analytics, etc.)
        - Do not mention the actual ICE scores in your response
        - Recommendations should demonstrate expertise and provide value even if they don't become a client
